# A Brief History of Time: from Microsoft **TTD** to malware analysis⏱️

### At [Airbus CERT](https://github.com/airbus-cert), we love to fly though time ✈️

With the successful release of [ttddbg](https://github.com/airbus-cert/ttddbg), the Airbus CERT team understood the potential of [Microsoft *Time Travel Debugging* (*TTD*)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview) for security purposes. Hence, as an intern for five months at Airbus CERT, I continued to dig into this topic to discover what other secrets could be hiding through time.

## A little travel back in time: Microsoft **Time Travel Debugging**

*Time Travel Debugging* - or *TTD* - is a feature of the native Windows debugger *WinDbg*.

It allows you to capture a trace of a process during its execution and to store the result in a *trace file*. The most famous use cases are:
- Replay the trace with the same execution context
- Replay forward and backwards a trace
- Share a recorded session easily without worrying about reproducing the bug

The security community quickly started adopting *TTD* for bug hunting. The killer feature that allows going backwards in a debugger is handy for finding bug sources in a binary. 

![Time travel!](/images/ttd/time_travel.png)

In the malware analysis field, *TTD* had a smaller impact, even if its potential is huge! Here are a few ideas:
- Use *TTD* as a sandbox to record malware behaviour
- Record malware execution in a trace file and then analyze this file with classical static tools
- Use *TTD* to bypass anti-debug technics

Of course, *TTD* is proprietary software, which implies two things:
- This work could not exist without [**ttd-bindings**](https://github.com/commial/ttd-bindings). A huge thanks to the contributors to this project 🙏
- Secondly, this project **supports Windows only 🪟** (for now) because it needs to use the *TTD* dll to replay traces. As a former avid Linux user, I had to grin and bear it 🥲

It is worth mentioning that in the middle of my internship, Microsoft released a significant update of *TTD*. First, they announced the end of the *preview* period and then released a [*TTD.exe* command line utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-ttd-exe-command-line-util). Thanks to it, automation is now more straightforward!

## Trace child processes: **TTDProcessTracker**

At the beginning of my internship, there was no way to record a child process because the *TTD.exe command line utility* wasn't released. In *WinDbg*, the feature was disabled, probably because it wasn't implemented yet.
However, many samples I am dealing with create new child processes and recording with *TTD* was a pain.

![inception](/images/ttd/inception.png)

That's why I decided to develop the feature by myself! The goal was to create a Windows driver that could trace a PID and suspend any child processes created by this PID. Then, the driver informs the client that a new child was suspended, and the client attaches *TTD* to this new PID. Finally, the client resumes the new child process!

![TTDProcessTracker scheme](/images/ttd/scheme.png)

Of course, in the middle of the project, Microsoft released its *TTD.exe command line utility*, and my project became useless... 🥲
Of course, it didn't because it was my first experience with Windows drivers, and I learnt a lot! ⚙️

I still released the source code of the project for fun and profit! You can check it out at [TTDProcessTracker](https://github.com/atxr/ttdprocesstracker).

![TTDProcessTracker demo](/images/ttd/pt_demo.gif)

## *TTD* detection: **anti-ttd**

Once I finished the development of *TTDProcessTracker*, I tried to test it on the [pyarmor](https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor) packer.
This packer creates a temp folder with all the required DLLs and restarts the process within this directory. 

![pyarmor scheme](/images/ttd/pyarmor.png)

I packed a simple "Hello World" Python script and tried to run TTDProcessTracker on it, and ... it failed. Actually, it didn't really fail because I could record both the original and newly created process, but the second one crashed before printing "Hello, World!". I was probably facing an anti-debug trick that could detect *TTD*. 

That's why I decided to create [**anti-ttd**](https://github.com/atxr/anti-ttd), a research project to test all the existing anti-debug technics on *TTD* to see how I could block/hide it.

I used [unprotect.it](https://unprotect.it) to get a good start on well-known anti-debug technics and noticed that most of these classical tricks don't work on *TTD* because it isn't *real* debugger.

When recording a process with *TTD*, a DLL is injected into the process and records the process in a *.run* file. Hence, I also designed several *TTD* specific anti-debug technics:

👪 **Parent process**: 
Check if the parent process is *ttd.exe*. It can be bypassed if the *ttd.exe* binary is renamed. 

🧩 **DLL detection**: 
Scan the DLL loaded and search for *TTDRecord.dll*. It can be bypassed if the DLL is renamed.

📂 **Open handles**: 
Scan the handles opened by the process and search for *.run* files. If the current process is recorded by *ttd.exe*, it will automatically record the data into a *.run* file.

> 🔎 **Note**:
>
> Even if I learned a lot with *anti-ttd*, I still have no idea how *pyarmor* defeats *TTD*. Even with the official release of Windows *TTD.exe* command line utility and its child-tracking feature, I cannot record this pyarmor sample. Curiously, I did record properly 2 times the binary with *TTDProcessTracker* (it was fully random), but I didn't investigate yet on the traces. I created [an issue on the anti-ttd repo](https://github.com/atxr/anti-ttd/issues/1) with all the information.

## The ultimate packer nemesis: **yara-ttd**

> **📽️ Note:**
>
>Watch *yara-ttd* introduction during [my rump at SSTIC 2023](https://static.sstic.org/rumps2023/SSTIC_2023-06-08_P12_RUMPS_17.mp4)  (🥐 french only 🥐)

[YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) is a powerful pattern-matching tool for binaries.
Thanks to YARA, we can save much time by automatically classifying malware samples in a pipeline before analyzing them.

> YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA, you can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns.
>
> -- <cite>[YARA documentation](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/)</cite>

Unfortunately, most malware samples are protected with different kinds of **packers**. A classical runtime-packer scheme like [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) or [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) consists of self-extracting and running obfuscated and sometimes encrypted code.
Therefore, YARA cannot deal with packed binaries because it won't find matches in the packed code.

💡 **The idea behind **[yara-ttd](https://github.com/airbus-cert/yara-ttd)** is to use the trace files recorded by *TTD* with *yara* itself to defeat packers.**

Because *yara* cannot scan the packed binary itself, *yara-ttd* provides a way to analyze the trace file that contains all the runtime information, including the unpacking process.
With *yara-ttd*, you can select a set of positions in the trace file to scan the memory with your *yara* rules.
Hence, you can hook the packed binary wherever you want with your *yara* rules!

*yara-ttd* provides several memory scanning strategies, like loaded module memory and virtual memory allocation.

### A binary packed with UPX
A simple binary that launches calc.exe, packed with [UPX](https://upx.github.io).
_yara-ttd_ finds the `calc.exe` string in the module memory during thread creation.

### An obfuscated shellcode that runs `calc.exe`

The tested binary decrypts a shellcode and runs it in a new thread.
_yara-ttd_ finds the `calc.exe` string on the heap when hooking on the `ntdll!NtCreateThreadEx` function.

## Extract my *TTD* trace: **ttd2mdmp**

During [a chat with the *capa* team from Mandiant](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/issues/1654), I discovered Windows Minidumps. They are usually used to save a context during a crash. They store partial information about registers, memory, threads, and systems...

There are many previous works on Minidumps analysis compared to *TTD* trace, and that's why I started to build [**ttd2mdmp**](https://github.com/airbus-cert/ttd2mdmp), a tool to extract a Minidump from a *TTD* trace.

![ttd2mdmp](/images/ttd/ttd2mdmp.gif)

As for *yara-ttd*, you must choose a time position to generate the Minidump. This can be done either with a *TTD* time position or with a function hook, which will extract as many Minidumps as hooks.

Thanks to *ttd2mdmp*, you can extract the following data:

🧵 Threads:
- Thread id
- Thread stack range
- Thread stack
- Thread context
- TEB

🧩 Modules:
- Module name
- Module memory range
- Module memory

📑 Heap
- Heap ranges generated by tracing ntdll!NtAllocateVirtualMemory calls
- Heap memory

⚙️ System Information
- Processor architecture

## Dynamic feature analysis: **capa** & **TTD**

After the first release of *yara-ttd*, I started to talk with the *capa* team from Mandiant.
One of the ideas they released for the Google Summer of Code 2023 was *adding dynamic feature analysis*.

Two usages of *TTD* and *capa* were highlighted during the discussion:

📄 **Run *capa* on *TTD* trace files**:

The idea could be to use *TTD* as a sandbox to extract API calls, strings, memory dumps, register context... Currently, *capa* is starting to add dynamic features with [CAPE](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2). After the release of this new feature, there could also be a *TTD* version. The entire discussion is available [here](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/issues/1655).

💉 **Extract and analyze Minidumps**: 

First, dump a *TTD* trace at a given position to generate a Minidump. Thanks to *ttd2mdmp*, this is now possible. Then, perform an extended static analysis with the Minidump context (thread, memory, register, return address...). The goal is to build a Minidump feature extractor to feed the *capa* engine. This feature still needs to be implemented; see [this issue](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/issues/1654) to stay up to date.

## **TTD** sandbox automation: [**autottd**](https://github.com/atxr/autottd)

Thanks to all the projects I worked on, I believe *TTD* could be a massive asset in the security field. However, there is still a blind spot. 

At this point, when working on a sample, you need to fire up a Windows virtual machine, install *WinDbg*, record the trace and then export the trace file to work on it. This process could be faster and prevent us from deploying the *TTD* tools on an automated pipeline.

That's why sandbox automation is among the most critical incoming work in this *TTD* journey.

I started to desing [autottd](https://github.com/atxr/autottd), an *AWS* prototype that would automate the recording of a sample inside an EC2 instance.

## Conclusion

I would like to thanks the CERT team for welcoming me during this wonderful internship, especially [Sylvain Peyrefitte](https://github.com/citronneur), my tutor, who was the mind behind most of these project ideas 💡
