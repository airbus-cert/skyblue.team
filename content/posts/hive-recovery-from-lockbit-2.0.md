The [LockBit 2.0 ransomware](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/lockbit-resurfaces-with-version-2-0-ransomware-detections-in-chi.html) has been incredibly "productive" these last few months: their technique is well automated, and the list of compromised companies keeps growing every day.

In order to reduce the destructiveness of their payload, most ransomware operators do not encrypt every single file on a system; instead, they set out a set of rules, for example:

- Only encrypt files with specific extensions: `.docx`, `.cpp`, `.db`, `.log`
- Don't encrypt files in `C:\Windows\System32`, in order to keep a semi-working machine (otherwise how would the users read the ransom note?)

LockBit 2.0 has a pretty interesting quirk though: as an optimization, only the first 4KiB (4096 bytes) of each file are encrypted. This is usually enough to lock away important data and make file recovery a pain. It also speeds up the encryption process.

We have also observed that the LockBit 2.0 ransomware is pretty generous in the extension list it encrypts: even user hive files (`NTUSER.DAT`) are encrypted, which is a pain if we want to [extract useful data from it](https://github.com/airbus-cert/regrippy/). But registry hives can be pretty big, could we maybe recover some data anyway?

## Registry hive structure

In order to understand how we can recover the hives, we must first have a look at how registry hives are stored on-disk. Willi Ballenthin's [`python-registry`](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry) has some good explanations, including [a text file from a certain B.D.](https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry/blob/master/documentation/WinReg.txt) which goes over the structure of hives for both Windows 95 and NT. This document tells us that NT optimized hive loading by making the header the typical size of a page, *4KiB*.

This means that LockBit only encrypts the header, and doesn't touch the actual data of the hive. Is it possible to restore the header? To answer this question, we must list everything the header contains:

- A magic number (`regf`)
- Sequence numbers (used for inconsistency detection)
- Modification timestamp
- Version numbers
- Hive name
- Hive flags
- Header checksum

Basically, we can see that the header is mostly self-contained: there's no reference to `hbin` offset, or a global hive checksum. There should be no problem restoring the header by copying it from another hive of the same type ðŸ˜Š

## Restoring the hive

Simply by copying over the first 4096 bytes from another, clear `NTUSER.DAT`, we were able to entirely recover all our user hives!

```
$ regrip.py --ntuser ./ntuser_recovered.dat userassist | wc -l
84
```

It works! RegRippy will be confused when trying to give you the user names when extracting data from `NTUSER.DAT`, because it guesses them based on the hive name, which has been copied over from a clean hive. Other than that, everything works as expected, and all data is accessible.

If you ever encounter this issue, here's a script which can restore an encrypted `NTUSER.DAT` hive: it's basically rebuilding the header and replacing it to create a clean hive.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Fix encrypted hives by repairing the header (only for NTUSER.DAT)")

    parser.add_argument("--user", type=str, help="The user name to store in the header (default: JohnDoe)", default="JohnDoe")
    parser.add_argument("hive_path", type=str, help="Encrypted hive path")
    parser.add_argument("output", type=str, help="Where to output the fixed hive")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    hive_name = "??\\C:\\Users\\" + args.user + "\\ntuser.dat"
    encoded_hive_name = hive_name.encode("utf-16-le")
    if len(encoded_hive_name) > 64:
        encoded_hive_name = encoded_hive_name[:64]
    else:
        encoded_hive_name += b"\x00" * (64 - len(encoded_hive_name))

    header = b"regfH\x1E\x00\x00\x48\x1E\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x20\x00\x00\x00\x00\x80\x0E\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00"
    header += encoded_hive_name
    header += b"\x43\xBE\x11\x44\xFF\x07\xE8\x11\x92\x75\xEA\x28\xA0\xD0\x3E\x60\x43\xBE\x11\x44\xFF\x07\xE8\x11\x92\x75\xEA\x28\xA0\xD0\x3E\x60\x00\x00\x00\x00\x44\xBE\x11\x44\xFF\x07\xE8\x11\x92\x75\xEA\x28\xA0\xD0\x3E\x60\x72\x6D\x74\x6D\xBE\x82\x8C\x05\xB7\xB9\xD7\x01\x4F\x66\x52\x67\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
    header += b"\x00"*316
    header += b"\xD8\xC9\x70\x75"
    header += b"\x00"*3584

    with open(args.hive_path, "rb") as h1:
        with open(args.output, "wb") as h2:
            data = h1.read()
            without_header = data[4096:]
            h2.write(header)
            h2.write(without_header)

    print("Done! Hive written to", args.output)
